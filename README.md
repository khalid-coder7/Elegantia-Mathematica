### Visually Refined and Conceptually Elegant Mathematics Notes

This repository contains a curated collection of mathematics-heavy notes developed over five years of study in **Mechatronics Engineering**.

These notes go beyond standard coursework. Rather than following the curriculum mechanically, I synthesized material from textbooks, lecture notes, and selected articles to distill the **core mathematical ideas** in an **intuitive, deductive, and structured manner**.  
All notes were **designed and created entirely by me using Adobe Illustrator**, with attention to visual clarity and conceptual elegance.

## Philosophy

The guiding principles behind these notes are:

- **Conceptual elegance over rote formalism**
- **Intuition-first, deductive development**
- **Clarity, structure, and mathematical coherence**
- **Visual aesthetics as a tool for understanding**

Each document was carefully crafted using **Adobe Illustrator**, with deliberate attention to:
- layout and spacing
- color harmony
- typographic hierarchy
- visual flow of ideas

The goal was not only correctness, but *readability, beauty, and insight*.

## Content

The notes cover mathematics-intensive topics encountered throughout an engineering curriculum, including but not limited to:

- Linear algebra
- Calculus and multivariable analysis
- Differential equations
- Probability and stochastic systems
- Signals and systems
- Control theory and estimation-related mathematics

The emphasis throughout is on **structure, interpretation, and unifying ideas**, aimed at enhancing understanding in **math-heavy courses**.
